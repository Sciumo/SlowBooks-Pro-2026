"""#174: the Job Cost Entry dialog's cost lines were cut off.

Eleven columns in a 700px dialog whose table container hides overflow: the
Bill? column and the remove button were behind the edge with no scrollbar,
and the selects had shrunk to a few characters. The dialog opens wide now
and the table scrolls sideways when the window is narrower still.
